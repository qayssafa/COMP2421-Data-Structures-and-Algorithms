# COMP2421-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms_system-to-manage-patients-data-in-a-hospital
In this project required of me to implement a program to help creating the system by including the following operations of an AVL tree:
• Read the file patients.txt and load the data (i.e., AVL Tree).
• Insert a new patient from user with all its associated data.
• Find a patient and give the user the option to update the information 
of the patient if found.
• List all patients in lexicographic order with their associated 
information.
• List all patients that have the same illness.
• Delete a patient from the system.
• Save all words in file “patients_hash.data”
